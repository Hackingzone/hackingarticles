Mjolnir is the mythical hammer of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Mjolnir was a 
fearsome weapon said to be capable of leveling mountains and unleashing lightning. 
The Vikings wore amulets shaped like Mjolnir for protection, and more than a thousand
 have been found across Northern Europe. This constellation symbolizes Fermi's work 
investigating Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) associated with lightning from 
thunderstorms on Earth.

A thunderstorm is a powerful natural particle accelerator. It can generate streams of
 subatomic particles moving near the speed of light that result in a flash of gamma 
rays lasting about a thousandth of a second. TGFs were discovered in the 1990s by 
Fermi's predecessor, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and Fermi has greatly expanded
 on its findings. Fermi's Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detects about two TGFs every 
day as it orbits Earth.
