Captain America's shield is his primary weapon. The most well-known of his shields is 
a disc-shaped object with a five-pointed star design in its center, within blue, red, 
and white concentric circles. This shield is composed of a unique Vibranium, 
Proto-Adamantium alloy, and an unknown third component.
