Stormbreaker is an enchanted axe used by Thor. It was forged from Uru on Nidavellir.
Eitri claimed the weapon was meant to become the strongest weapon in Asgard's history.
Stormbreaker was used in the Battle of Wakanda to great effect, augmenting Thor's own
lightning massively. Notably, of all the battles, it was the only weapon that severely
 wounded Thanos by impaling him soon after the Infinity Gauntlet was completed. 
However, Thor intentionally aimed for Thanos' chest, resulting in Thanos only being 
badly injured rather than instantly killed. This allowed Thanos to activate the 
Infinity Gauntlet, and eliminate fifty percent of the universe's life. Moreover, 
Thanos would also fully recover from the said mortal wound by the time he had 
arrived on the Garden to recover. As Thanos teleported away, Stormbreaker fell to the
 ground, the blade covered in his blood.
