The Yaka Arrow is a whistle-controlled arrow made from Yaka that uses technology 
native to the Centaurian people. The Yaka Arrow was Yondu Udonta's favored weapon.
Yondu Udonta, a Centaurian and the leader of the spacefaring smugglers known as the 
Ravagers, is widely recognized for carrying a Yaka Arrow, which he keeps close by in 
a holster at his side. Udonta often relies on his arrow to intimidate others while 
either brokering deals, interrogating others, or dealing with defiant or insubordinate
 crew members, maneuvering the arrow close to the person's head to threaten and 
intimidate them into complying with his interests. Highly skilled in its usage, 
Udonta always kept one in a holster by his side.
